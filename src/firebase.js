 * To get the Firebase config, first go to the Firebase Homepage (https://console.firebase.google.com/) and click on

 * In the Firebase projectâ€™s homepage, you will notice three circular icons. The first two will contain code

 * one will have code that will help you connect the project to a web app (which is what we want).
 * 
 * Click on it and copy the apiKey, authDomain, databaseURL, projectId, storageBucket, messagingSenderId, 
 * and appId values.
